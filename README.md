# SHIPSmart

## Inspiration 

With sharply rising insurance premiums, students at UC Davis frequently underutilize their UC SHIP benefits, missing critical preventative care and cost-saving opportunities. There's a clear need to bridge the gap between available coverage and student awareness.

Our solution provides UC SHIP enrollees with a personalized, AI-driven insurance companion that simplifies coverage details, promotes timely preventive care, and prevents unexpected medical bills.

## Key Objectives

1. Boost awareness and use of preventative care

2. Support underutilizers with targeted analytics

3. Simplify policy navigation and referrals

4. Reduce unexpected costs with AI-driven negotiation

5. Streamline appointment booking and network usage

## How we built it

Designed the app on figma. Implemented frontend using swiftui. Cerebas for AI. Regression model. Letta framework to build complex agent + API call.
